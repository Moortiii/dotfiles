# TODO:

* Automatically set up Firefox with settings (no password saving) + default extensions
* Configure ewwbar
* Configure i3lock
* Remove failing i3blocks
* Configure wallpaper
* Set up default folders, maybe download a given set of repositories immediately, e.g. advent of code?
* Pyenv setup
* Poetry setup
* How does Pants work with all of this?
